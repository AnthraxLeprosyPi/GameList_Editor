# GameList Editor
GameList Editor is a tool written in Delphi to help the edition of gamelist.xml files generated from UXS for Recalbox or Retropie.

It relies heavily on the fact that your gamelist.xml have been generated by Universal XML Scraper by Screech:

It is developed with Embarcadero 10.2.1 (Tokyo) but it has been tested and builds too on Embarcadero 10.1 (Berlin).
All you need is the source code, and the Resources folder to be placed in the same directory as your .exe file.

This is an alpha version for the moment, many features will be added in the future but it is already pretty fast.
(It loads my 5 systems with almost 3000 games in less than a second).
For now, your folder with all your roms floder must be placed on your computer, but I plan to add the possibility to make it access your folder directly on your RaspBerry Pi.

Also, it is Windows only because it relies on VCL in Delphi, but I may consider an FMX version once it's stable, thus it would work under Linux and MacOS.
