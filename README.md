GameList Editor is a tool written in Delphi to help the edition of gamelist.xml files generated from UXS for Recalbox or Retropie.

It relies heavily on the fact that your gamelist.xml have been generated by Universal XML Scraper by Screech:

# For Developers :
It is developed with Embarcadero 10.2.1 (Tokyo) but it has been tested and builds too on Embarcadero 10.1 (Berlin).
All you need is the source code, and the Resources folder to be placed in the same directory as your .exe file.
You also need to put the plink.exe in the resources folder.

# For users :
All you need is the package available in the release section.
Just unzip and you're good to go !!

This is an alpha version for the moment, many features will be added in the future but it is already pretty fast.
(It loads my 5 systems with almost 3000 games in less than a second).

Also, it is Windows only because it relies on VCL in Delphi, but I may consider an FMX version once it's stable, thus it would work under Linux and MacOS.
